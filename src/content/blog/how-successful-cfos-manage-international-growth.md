_Lessons from working with ambitious global companies, big and small -_ _by [Alex Axentiev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/axentiev/)._

As companies expand and venture into international markets, they encounter a host of challenges. From navigating foreign payments and managing currency risk to optimising cash flow, these complexities can hinder growth and profitability. 

In this blog article, we will explore the common obstacles faced by finance teams in international business and discuss innovative solutions to overcome them. 

#### SIMPLIFYING INTERNATIONAL PAYMENTS

One of the first things that finance teams must figure out when doing business internationally is how to pay or collect in foreign markets. Do they need to open accounts in several countries? How to do it? And how to operate them with the required controls and visibility? Traditional methods such as SWIFT transfers or checks, are time-consuming, costly and prone to errors.

_**So, what can you do in order to support your business growing internationally while keeping things simple, safe and cost-effective?**_

Today you can open a single account with one of the fintech providers that can support most of your business needs without bringing the complexity of maintaining accounts in multiple banks. A single account can give you a set of addressable bank requisites, where you can get paid via local payment schemes such as Faster Payments in the UK, SEPA in Europe or ACH in the US. This will save you both time and money in terms of paying or collecting from your suppliers and buyers and keeping working capital efficient. The same account can also help you pay or collect via SWIFT without the expensive fees that incumbent banks charge.

#### AVOID A CHESS MATE FROM CURRENCY RISKS 

Cash flow, liquidity management and hedging have been increasing in importance for CFOs, and if you have a board or VC investors, you can expect the same questions as you grow.

Our advice? Never wait until FX becomes a recurring discussion with the board. It is a prime sign that you need at least a basic policy in place to align everyone and avoid future frustrations.

In fact, one of the most popular reasons CFOs turn to HedgeFlows is when they have to explain the impact of foreign currencies on their bottom line to their CEOs or are facing the challenge of formulating proposals on how to manage these currency risks to the board. There are many uncertainties businesses face, and many are are hard to quantify and avoid. FX is not one of them. Having a clear understanding of the potential currency risks and developing effective hedging strategies is essential.

-   Determining realistic budget rates

#### DEBUNKING HEDGING MYTHS

There are common misconceptions around hedging, such as believing that high-margin companies do not require hedging. However, even profitable organizations like Apple and Microsoft actively hedge their currency risks due to unique factors influencing their business models. Understanding the nuances of hedging strategies tailored to a company's specific circumstances in essential. With comprehensive visibility into forecasted cash flows and robust frameworks, companies can make informed hedging decisions that align with their risk tolerance, market conditions, and long-term objectives. By debunking these myths and embracing hedging as a proactive risk management tool, businesses can protect their profitability, mitigate potential losses, and navigate volatile currency markets with confidence.
