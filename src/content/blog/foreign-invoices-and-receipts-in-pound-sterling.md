Send invoices in Pounds Sterling, get paid by overseas customers in their currency, and forget about messy reconciliations.

#### WHY KEEPING EVERYTHING IN £ MAKES SENSE

Small businesses that sell to B2B customers overseas have difficult choices in how they get paid. Many go for the simple option - only deal with customers who can pay in Pounds Sterling. Take it or leave it. Those for whom foreign markets are important will accept payments in foreign currencies, which traditionally brings additional costs and accounting burdens.

Invoicing and getting paid in Pounds Sterling has the advantage of not having to deal with exchange rate risk. However, in many cases, customers from abroad may prefer to pay in their own currency. Businesses that find themselves in this situation can hedge against currency risk by securing their exchange rates in advance. This pre-booking process locks the current exchange rate so they can use it in future when the invoices or collections are due. The advantage is clear: if the rate moves against you while you're waiting for payment, you won't lose. 

Currency moves can have an impact on your cashflows. Removing this uncertainty from your finances is key to avoid unnecessary surprises. Thanks to new solutions, small businesses can finally square the circle - invoice customers in Pounds Sterling and get paid in foreign currency without introducing unnecessary currency costs and messy reconciliations.
