As we start the new year in earnest, our clients have been telling us how they want to transform finance in their companies, from trusted advisors to strategic transformers in 2025. Everyone agrees that finance teams are undergoing a seismic shift. To stay ahead, they must transcend traditional career paths and become dynamic enablers of strategy and digital transformation.

This evolution hinges on five key dimensions:

#### 1\. Honest Brokers of Strategy

Finance teams play a critical role as unbiased arbiters in strategic decisions. With their objectivity, they’re uniquely positioned to prioritise and allocate budgets across competing products, divisions, or functions—often casting the deciding vote. Many finance leaders tell us they will be taking a more active role in commercial strategy.



#### 2\. Data-Driven Change Agents

Data is the new currency of decision-making, and finance teams must embrace their role as data scientists. By democratising data and fostering collaboration across the organisation, they can drive insight-driven decisions to the lowest levels, boosting agility and innovation and removing organisational biases that have built up over many years. The promise of AI, autonomous finance and predictive analytics can make this a reality.

#### 3\. Proactive Risk Managers

From climate change to cybersecurity, modern risks are more complex than ever. Finance must move beyond analysing traditional financial models and master data and more complex modelling while critically evaluating them to ensure decisions are both defensible and transparent—a vital capability in an era of heightened accountability.

#### 4\. Productivity Pioneers

Beyond profitability, which is already well measured, finance teams can champion discussions on productivity. By analysing labour, materials, technology, and capital, they can uncover deeper insights and unlock growth, navigating the defensiveness such conversations can provoke.

#### 5\. Creative Talent Acquisition

Finally, forward-looking finance leaders must hire outside traditional moulds, seeking diverse skill sets and fresh perspectives to tackle tomorrow’s challenges. Building teams with diverse skill sets and fresh perspectives is a key way to prepare for future challenges. But make sure your processes are up to scratch first! Finance team members consistently tell us they joined a company to make a real difference, not to perform repetitive admin tasks! This disconnect between expectation and reality is the #1 reason companies lose good finance staff!



Finance’s transformation from trusted advisors to strategic transformers will shape the future of business. Are your teams ready?
