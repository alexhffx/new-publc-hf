If growing your business overseas is on your key priority list, then we need to talk about bamboos. Why? They grow quickly and resiliently. Two values we're sure you'd like for your own business. In this article, we explain how you can unlock international growth to compete safely by making the right decisions with your finances.

### What the \[h\]edge!; or why bamboos?

Whether you like bamboo or not, you can't help but feel certain admiration for this plant once you get to know it a bit better. They are not just one of the fastest growing plants on the planet; their resilience and mouldability means that they can serve many purposes  - alive and as a material source. But, why the \[H\]edge are we talking about bamboos anyway? Bamboos are fundamental to the balance of oxygen in the atmosphere, and so are SMEs to the UK economy; the powerhouse that drives UK plc forward!

Many small and medium businesses aspire to grow as quickly and resiliently as bamboo does. And the most natural way of achieving this is by 'expanding their branches', or what in many cases translates into; doing business internationally. The problem comes when these companies realise that accessing the tools and advice needed to see the light and be successful in this new forest is not as easy as they expected. 

Understanding how your international finances can become as resilient as a bamboo to, therefore, achieve quick international growth, is fundamental for success. However, here comes a clue:

### Cheap cross-border payments don't cut it

Cheap cross-border payments for SMEs are like free-draining soil to bamboo. They represent only the most basic conditions needed to survive, but they do not, on their own, guarantee international growth or success!.

There are quite a few ingredients you would need to overcome the common challenges of international trade; payment fees, fraud prevention or unexpected fees and costs are some of those challenges. But we wouldn't make them any justice covering them all in just one blog post. We have good news though, keep reading!
