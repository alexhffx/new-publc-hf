As the financial landscape continues to evolve, the adoption of Open Banking and the emergence of virtual wallets are reshaping how businesses manage their finances. In this article, we'll explore the differences between Open Banking and Virtual Wallets, and why HedgeFlows has chosen to integrate virtual wallets and payment automation solutions into its platform to better serve its international trading customers.

### THE ROAD TO PSD3 AND OPEN BANKING ADOPTION

The financial industry is eagerly anticipating PSD3, which promises to address some of the challenges associated with Open Banking. However, with a go-live date set for December 2025, its impact will not be felt in the immediate future. Currently, the UK leads the way in Open Banking adoption, showcasing its potential benefits. Nonetheless, widespread adoption and enhanced functionality are still necessary for the masses to fully capitalise on its advantages.

### OPEN BANKING VS VIRTUAL WALLETS

One recurring question we encounter at Hedgeflows is the distinction between Open Banking and Virtual Wallets. For businesses that require bulk payments, Open Banking may not always be the ideal solution, as its coverage and success rates are not yet universally satisfactory. Although some banks may support bulk payments, it often lacks international payment options, limiting the number of accessible bank accounts.

On the other hand, the emergence of virtual wallets has addressed many of the challenges faced in making bulk payments across different banks, providing a more versatile solution. At present, virtual wallets present themselves as a superior alternative to Open Banking due to their wider reach and convenience.

### HEDGEFLOWS' ROLE IN EMPOWERING INTERNATIONAL TRADERS

Hedgeflows is dedicated to assisting Small and Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs) engaged in international trade. These businesses have diverse needs, ranging from efficient currency payments in multiple currencies to complex requirements like pre-booking currency to mitigate exchange rate risks. Virtual wallets and payment automation solutions enable Hedgeflows to cater to these varied needs seamlessly, becoming a must-have feature for its users.
