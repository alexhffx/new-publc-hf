### HedgeFlows Joins The 2023 Barclays Rise Growth Academy

The HedgeFlows team has now officially joined the Barclays’ Rise Growth Academy 2023 cohort! The partnership recognises our impact and innovation, as one of only 16 high-aspiration Fintech companies selected globally. The ten week, digital-first programme will be a transformative educational step in the scaling of HedgeFlows.

### Scaling up with Barclays:

On the 19th of October, we joined the Barclays Rise class of 2023, a virtual community of world class Fintech innovators. By partaking in this partnership opportunity and ten-week course, we hope to develop the impact that our unique treasury management solution can have for SMEs and mid-market companies and support other budding founders in the Fintech space.

Whilst enrolled in The Barclays Academy, HedgeFlows and the other cohort members will receive exclusive, educational modules and 1:1 sessions with industry leaders. Rise 2023 mentors include Ilias Sarris, the Senior Strategy Manager at Accenture, and Joel Perlman, founder of OakNorth Credit Intelligence.

We are excited by the prospect of scaling HedgeFlows with the exclusive skillset modules, which range from foundership mentoring to Fintech-specific networking and marketing. We are particularly excited by the prospect of growing alongside fifteen other high-aspiration Fintechs, including Nook, upSWOT, Wellthi, and Facctum. 

### Learning how to best support SMEs:

As a treasury management solution, designed to help SMEs grow and compete internationally through the management of their foreign cash flows and financial risks the HedgeFlows solution has helped SMEs and mid-market companies to grow internationally. Our’ off-the-shelf integrations offer small businesses the resources and services that are often unavailable to them through banks. 

This opportunity stands HedgeFlows in great stead to continue to address the empowerment of SMEs within the UK economy and when making cross-border payments to grow internationally. We will be honing the skills that help serve our customers, whilst also learning from similarly sized Fintech ventures and the team at Barclays. We can’t think of a better way to address the disparity in global payments than by learning from a multinational bank and such an impressive global community.
