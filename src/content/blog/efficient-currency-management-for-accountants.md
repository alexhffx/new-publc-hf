Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) are increasingly venturing into international trade. However, navigating foreign markets can be daunting, leading to unexpected costs and risks. Many SMEs lose money due to challenges such as foreign exchange losses and hidden bank fees. To address these issues, accountants can play a pivotal role by offering advisory services to help SMEs understand foreign currency impact and implement processes to mitigate unnecessary costs and risks. This article explores how accountants can create revenue opportunities while assisting their clients in unlocking safer international growth.

### Beyond timing: robust Currency Management

When dealing with foreign currencies, many assume that timing the exchange is the key to success. However, the currency market's unpredictable nature makes consistent timing nearly impossible. Large companies have recognised this and instead focus on robust cost and risk management. Accountants should educate clients that effective currency management involves more than just exchange timing, emphasising the importance of cost and risk mitigation strategies.

### The privileged relationship between Accountants and SMEs

A significant number of SMEs engage in international trade, but very few manage their currencies effectively. SME directors and finance managers often lack the expertise to handle international finances without expert guidance. Accountants can fill this void by providing specialised assistance, as banks and fintechs may not offer solutions tailored to smaller businesses. This presents a unique opportunity for accountants to support SMEs in optimising their currency-related decisions.

### Understanding FX and payment fees with HedgeFlows

The [FX Gains & Losses](https://help.hedgeflows.com/how-to-use-fx-gains-losses-explainer-for-xero) line on accounting statements can be confusing due to issues such as stale rates and mixed costs. HedgeFlows offers easy-to-understand reports that break down FX Gains & Losses to the transaction level, helping SMEs uncover hidden costs and comprehend how currency fluctuations impact their finances.
