If doing business in one currency sounds like a dream, you're not alone. Trading internationally as a small business can seem complicated, unclear and even risky. In this blog article, we explore why this is and the options available to trade globally in a fair and simple way.



#### how small businesses manage foreign finances

Foreign currencies fluctuate, making the value of your future payables and receivables uncertain. Businesses that trade globally usually have to choose between **simple** **but risky** and **safe** **but complicated** as alternatives for managing international finances**.**

Not surprisingly, 96% of small and medium-sized businesses start by choosing simple but risky - trade with suppliers or buyers in foreign currencies and take the risks and hassle of dealing with foreign currency amounts and associated [currency swings](/blog/protect-international-business-from-currency-swings) (1).  Sooner or later many repent as they have to endure stress and losses due to adverse currency moves.

The remaining 4% go with the safer but more complicated way of planning and protecting their foreign cashflows from currency swings. However, this usually comes with manual processes and related mistakes and using legacy solutions from their banks and other providers. So, what are the options?

#### EVERY INVOICE & PAYMENT IN HOME CURRENCY

Currency swings can have an impact on your cashflows and make you less competitive in foreign markets. So, how do you remove this uncertainty from your finances? Rather than choosing between stress and sweat, you can simply turn any specific foreign currency cashflow into domestic one.

And what are the results of doing this? **More predictable profit margins and cashflows + easier finances and accounting = happier customers.**
