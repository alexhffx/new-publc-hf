### What is Batch processing?

Batch processing payments is a financial process that enables multiple disparate payments to be prepared and paid in one run. For example, using a batch file which can contain numerous payments intended for one or multiple suppliers. 

Batch processing is a popular method for disbursing payments to suppliers and managing payroll. These payments are often automated and scheduled for specific times, such as at the end of the month. 

This method can be beneficial to finance teams of any size, as individual payment runs require a greater time commitment, and due to the repetition of the task, can be more susceptible to manual error. When done well, batch processing can increase productivity as it simplifies scheduling, time management, and team coordination.

### How to batch PROCESS Multiple payments:

1\. Select the invoices or outstanding payments that need to be settled.


2\. Have the selection reviewed by a colleague and/or obtain approval from the necessary management or authorised personnel. 



3\. Schedule the [payment run.](/fx-and-international-payments-for-small-businesses) 

4\. Ensure that sufficient funds are available in the account to cover payments.

5\. Reconcile and verify the payments against each corresponding invoice in your accounting system.

6\. Send remittances to the recipients to inform them of the payment and provide a confirmation of the purpose behind each payment.

### XERO batch payments: A step-by-step guide



1\. Open the ' **Bills To Pay'** table and tick the **Checkbox** of the relevant bills that you wish to batch process.

2\. When all bills are selected, click on ' **Make Payment'** to add them to a new batch payment.

4\. Select your payment method from the drop-down menu. Options are currently limited to **‘Create a payment file’** and **‘Mark as paid.'**

5\. Click on **'Create Payment'** to process the batch payment

### How Can I BATCH-PROCESS foreign bills to pay in Xero?

Regrettably, as of October 2023, foreign batch payments are not supported by Xero. Now, any user who makes international payments will have to process each one individually or find a suitable app that connects to Xero. 

This is a time-intensive, manual process as users will have no choice but to enter each bill one by one in Xero or wait for the following day to simplify the process via the bank fee. In any scenario, a user exclusively operating in Xero will experience delays and spend unnecessary time handling foreign invoices.

Xero offers various payment methods, including bank transfers and online payment platforms. The choice of payment method will depend on the recipient's preferences and the payment's urgency.

Xero currently lacks support for bulk payments in foreign currencies. However, you can seamlessly address this limitation by harnessing the power of tools like HedgeFlows, which enable you to efficiently process [bulk payments in Xero](/multi-currency-payments-app-for-xero) across a wide range of currencies.

Yes, Xero allows you to set up recurring bulk payments, which can be especially helpful for regular bills or payroll. Scheduling your bulk payments can improve vendor relationships, as well as save you hassle at month's end.

Xero automatically reconciles bulk payments with the corresponding bills or invoices. This reduces manual effort but may cause problems for foreign and bulk payments. Xero relies on exchange rates from XE.com, but when foreign currency invoices are eventually settled from your local currency account, Xero payments will employ actual exchange rates. This results in unrealised gains or losses which are magnified by the scale of bulk payments.
