**Value date** has several meanings depending on the area of its use. For the purpose of foreign currency payments, value date means the date when the ultimate recipient of the payment is expected to receive the funds.  For some derivative contracts, such as non-deliverable forwards or cross-currency swaps it means the date when a fluctuating price measure is observed for the purpose of calculation of the value of the payments.
