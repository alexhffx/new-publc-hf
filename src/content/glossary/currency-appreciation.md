**Currency appreciation** is the increase in the value of a country's currency with respect to one or more foreign reference currencies, typically in a floating exchange rate system in which no official currency value is maintained. There are many reasons for currency fluctuations ranging from a government & monetary policies, trade imbalances, attractiveness of the country as an investment destination and relative cycles versus other countries.
