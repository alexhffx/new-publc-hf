**Delivery date** or **settlement date** is the actual date when the foreign conversion payments for FX transactions usually take place. Spot FX transactions usually settle two bank business days after the actual transaction took place because of the cross-border nature of payments, checks and reconciliations that are necessary to settle one currency vs. another.  Forward FX and other FX derivatives transactions settle on-dates agreed bilaterally between parties of the contract.
