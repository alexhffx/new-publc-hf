**Collateral** is used by banks and other financial institutions to reduce the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative transactions. Collateral is usually cash or other assets held by or pledged to a party (the collateral holder) to ensure they can cover the losses in case of a default (failure to pay) of the counterparty.  The two most common components of collateral agreements are Initial Margin (also called security deposit) and Variation Margin.
