**Cross-border trade** refers to the flow of goods and services across international borders between jurisdictions. Cross-border trade has a higher level of complexity than domestic trade as businesses have to consider tax, customs, supply network and other legal consequences of buying or selling abroad. Nevertheless, the growth of eCommerce and other technology solutions have been instrumental in supporting the growth of cross-border trade.
