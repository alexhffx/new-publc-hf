**Currency controls also known as foreign exchange controls** are used by some governments to regulate and restrict the purchase or sale of foreign currencies by local residents and companies as well as the purchase of local currency by foreigners.  Currency controls are closely tied to cross-border payment regulations and are often designed to prevent speculative flows and capital outflows in Emerging market economies.
